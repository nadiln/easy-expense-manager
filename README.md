Easy Expense Manager is app built for technical test for MoneyLion.
I have built the expense tracker interface along with implementation of redux, redux sagas. Further it has the dashboard and add expense interface. Add Expense interface which is fully functional where we can save the expense to the store and also the development is done untilÂ it is connected to the remote server. I have commented out the line which is calling the Api but I have implemented the code. Meanwhile the Add Expense also loads the expense categories from the app redux store. I have attached the screenshots as well with this email.
